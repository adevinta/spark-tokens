# SPARK TOKENS - ANDROID DEMO

## DEMO SETUP

1. Open Android Studio
2. Click on Open an existing project
3. Navigate to the folder you cloned the repository into and select the build/android folder
4. Android Studio should run for a bit syncing dependencies and whatnot
5. Click the ▶️ button at the top to build and run the app in an emulator (you will need to have an emulator downloaded already)

Note: after you make any changes to the design tokens, you just need to rebuild Style Dictionary with `npm run build` in the root directory. Or you can use `npm start` which will watch for changes. After Style Dictionary builds, you can rebuild the Android application by clicking the ▶️ button in Android Studio.
