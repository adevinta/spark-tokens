# SPARK TOKENS - iOS DEMO

This demo uses SwiftUI.

## DEMO SETUP

1. Make sure you have Xcode 12 or greater installed
2. You will need [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed
3. Make sure you're into the build/ios/demo directory with `cd build/ios/demo`
4. Run `pod install` to install the SparkTokens CocoaPod
5. Open the Xcode workspace: `open SparkTokensDemo.xcworkspace`
6. Click the ▶️ button to build and run the demo

Note: if you add new files in the Style Dictionary configuration, you will need to run `pod install` in the `build/ios/demo` directory again so CocoaPods can link the newly generated files into Xcode
