# SPARK TOKENS - WEB DEMO

This demo uses Eleventy as a static site generator (SSG), but really you could use anything (Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, etc). Picking Eleventy arbitrarily and because it doesn't require any front-end framework like React or Vue.

## DEMO SETUP

1. Make sure you're into the build/web/demo directory with `cd build/web/demo`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This will also create a local dependency on our spark-tokens package with a symlink using npm link
3. Run npm start to start [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
4. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

Note: if you make any changes you will need to restart the 11ty server because it passes through the generated files from Style Dictionary.
